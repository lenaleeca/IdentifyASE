Here's a consolidated list of all the required input variables for the functions provided:

Required Input Variables

- `unique_pt_id`: Unique patient identifier.
- `seqnum`: Sequence number.
- `day`: Day of the observation.
- `bcx_daily`: Indicator for blood culture on that day.
- `vasop_daily`: Indicator for vasopressor use on that day.
- `imv_daily`: Indicator for invasive mechanical ventilation on that day.
- `lact_daily_hi`: High lactate levels on that day.
- `tbili_daily_hi`: High bilirubin levels on that day.
- `tbili_baseline`: Baseline bilirubin levels.
- `creat_daily_hi`: High creatinine levels on that day.
- `creat_baseline`: Baseline creatinine levels.
- `plt_daily_lo`: Low platelet count on that day.
- `plt_baseline`: Baseline platelet count.
- `esrd_icd`: Exclusion indicator.
- `new_abx_start`: Indicator for new antibiotic start on that day.
- `abx_daily`: Indicator for antibiotic use on that day.
- `death`: Indicator for death on that day.
- `ALL_DAYS`: Total number of days in the observation period.
- `transferout_id`: A vector of sequence numbers (`seqnum`) indicating patients who were transferred out acutely.
- `cohort_id`: A list of two vectors: the first vector contains patient IDs (`unique_pt_id`) and the second vector contains sequence numbers (`seqnum`) for selecting a sub-cohort (default is NULL).


Additional Function-Specific Variables

- `sliced_data_list`: A list of lists containing `unique_pt_id`, `seqnum`, and a data frame (`data`) with sliced data.
- `target_seqnum`: An integer specifying the sequence number to search for.
- `window_day_col`: A string specifying the name of the column indicating the presence of blood culture days within a specified window.
- `window`: An integer specifying the number of days before and after each day to check for blood culture days.
- `slide_day_before`: An integer specifying the number of days before each blood culture day to include in the slice (default is 2).
- `slide_day_after`: An integer specifying the number of days after each blood culture day to include in the slice (default is 6).
- `aim`: An integer specifying the aim criteria: 2 for specific criteria or 3 for extended criteria.
- `abx_window_startday`: Start day of antibiotic use within the window period (calculated within the function).
- `abx_qualifying_ep`: Indicator for qualifying antibiotic episode (calculated within the function).
- `aod_any_daily_comm`: Indicator for any acute organ dysfunction on that day (community-onset, calculated within the function).
- `aod_any_daily_hosp`: Indicator for any acute organ dysfunction on that day (hospital-onset, calculated within the function).
